## Kingland: Royale — Art Direction

### Visual Pillars
- Stylized high-fantasy, semi-cartoon. Readable silhouettes first, detail second.
- Color-coded elemental identity: Ignis (ember reds), Frost (icy blues), Aqua (teal/cyan), Verdant (greens).
- Sky-realm motifs: islands, sigils, runes, wind streaks, floating debris.

### Palette & Materials
- Background: deep navy gradients with subtle cyan/purple bloom.
- Units: flat-shaded base with single highlight rim; strong contrast against field.
- Effects: soft additive glows, radial pulses, line streaks.

### Shapes & Silhouettes
- Troops: circles/triangles/squares (placeholder) → later: distinct silhouettes (archers, brutes, sprites).
- Towers: rounded rectangles with faction color trims.
- Spells: pulses, rings, vines, shards.

### Animation (MVP → Stretch)
- MVP: scale/alpha tweens, small bob, hit flashes.
- Stretch: skeletal animations, squash/stretch, screen-space shader effects.

### UI
- Mobile-first, large touch targets. Warm accent (violet) and cool accent (cyan).
- HUD typography: system UI stack for performance; later swap to fantasy display font for headings.

### Asset Production Plan
- Phase A: Placeholder vector textures (procedural in Phaser).
- Phase B: Export SVG/PNG with 2–3 LODs; sprite sheets for VFX.
- Phase C: Audio (whooshes, pulses, rune ticks), mixed to -14 LUFS, short tails for mobile.
